# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
This repository covers the purpose, methodology, challenges, and results of an Excel analysis designed to help Louise, an up and coming playwright, start a crowdfunding campaign for her new play Fever. Louise has estimated her production to cost at least $10,000 and has provided past and current kickstarter campaign data in the form of a spreadsheet. In this project, I have been tasked with using Excel to organize, sort and analyze the crowdfunding data to determine the best approach for Louise to have a successful crowdfunding campaign. The data provided included a list of campaigns with its name, description, fundraising goal, pledged amount, outcome, country, launch date, deadline, number of donors, category and subcategory.
### Purpose
The objective of this analysis is to provide Louise with specific factors associated with successful campaigns in the theater category. Excel was used to filter categories, convert data into readable formats, use conditional formatting to identify various fundraising outcomes, and calculate performance indexes such as average donation  and percent funded of the fundraising goal. After analyzing the data, the PivotTable and PivotChart tools were used to depict the relevant data and correlations for Louise to apply to her own crowdfunding campaign. 
## Analysis and Challenges
I began the analysis by downloading the Kickstarter data and filtering out all non-theater categories, color coding each campaign outcome to differentiate between successful, failed, canceled and live outcomes, and converting launch date and deadline date to a readable formats. Then I used the processed data to make summary tables, bar charts and line graphs for visualization. This step makes it easier for Louise to review when applying the concepts to her own campaign. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first metric I analyzed was outcomes based on launch date. From the processed data, a PivotTable was created with parent category and year filters to show the number of successful, canceled and failed, theater campaigns per launch month. The results are as follows:

The results of this particular analysis show an increase of successful campaigns that launched in the summer months May - August with the greatest success in May. The number of failed campaigns appears to be consistent throughout the year with a slight increase during the summer as expected due to an increase in total launched campaigns. A small percentage of campaigns are canceled with no correlation to launch month.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next metric I analyzed was outcomes based on fundraising goal. For this metric, the count function was used to determine the outcomes  at each fundraising goal from $0 to $50,000 in increments of $5,000. I then calculated the percentage successful, percentage failed, and percentage canceled at each fundraising goal interval. The results are as follows:

The results of this analysis show the percentage of successful campaigns decreases with fundraising goal from $0 to $30,000, then begins to increase again from $30,000 to $45,000. Campaigns with a goal greater than $45,000 appear to have least success based on this pool of data. The greatest success rate is for campaigns with a goal less than $5,000 or between $35,000 and $45,000. Fundraisers with a goal similar to Louiseâ€™s target of $10,000 have a success rate of about 54%.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During this analysis, some of the challenges I encountered included formatting the date from the Unix timestamp, modifying formulas to account for errors in the data, and identifying outliers or unreliable datapoints. The Unix timestamps were converted using a start date of January 1, 1970. Formulas were modified using an =iferror() condition and outliers were identified using conditional formatting on the percentage funded column to color code outliers. Once these obstacles were addressed, the analysis became more user-friendly and easier to visualize. 
## Results
Based on the outcomes vs. launch date analysis, Louise should start her campaign during the summer months to increase her probability of meeting the fundraising goal. The results also give insight that more theater crowdfunding campaigns are launched in the summer months than in the winter months. Louise will have the lowest probability of meeting her fundraising goal if she launches in the winter months, particularly December. 
Based on the outcomes vs. fundraising goal analysis, Louise should make her fundraising goal as small as possible to meet her goal. This may seem obvious as less money will need to be collected, but the data shows that campaigns with a goal between $35,000 and $45,000 show similar success to campaigns with goals less than $10,000. Since Louise will likely not need to fundraise $35,000 for Fever, she should stick with her goal of $10,000 or decrease it to increase the probability of a successful campaign.
The limitations to this dataset include sample size and insight into the methods of fundraising. The sample size of theater campaigns with a fundraising goal greater than $15,000 are small compared to other subcategories. This may reduce the confidence in our analysis and could lead to false conclusions such as campaign success and failure at higher fundraising goals. Louise should be made aware of this limitation to make her own final decision on the course of her campaign. The limited insight into fundraising method may also have a profound impact on the results of this analysis. Some campaigns may have employed different strategies to gain donors (i.e. door-to-door, social media, advertising, etc.) that work better than others. Louise should do additional research on her own to determine how to maximize the pledged amount for her crowdfunding campaign.
Other possible tables or graphs that could have been created are length of campaign vs outcome, average donation vs outcome and number of donor vs outcome. We also could have given Louise measures of central tendency and spread for the theater and plays subcategory to see where her campaign fits into the general subcategory.
